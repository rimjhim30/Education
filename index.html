        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually 
        visible. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. Government ‘recognition’ is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all the conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality</p>
